script v1.py is the first version of the script in which each CNV call is matched to a genetic hotspot with overlap consisting of the proportion of CNV which is in the hotspot. cnv_hotspot_mapping.py on the other hand is the final version of the script where this is the opposite - the overlap consists of the percentage of known hotspot that is actually covered by called CNVs in samples.
